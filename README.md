# FRAMEPERFECTSUICIDE
I really wish I could say that this is some awesome, cool as f**k game, but it really isn't

This is simply nothing more than a project to try and learn godot, of course I'll keep on updating it to hopefully make it better and get it into a more-or-less playable state by... someday (maybe)

# Feedback?
If anybody stumbles across this silly project naturally and has some tips or pointers they'd like to give me, please feel more than free to do so, I'm still actively learning and looking for any forms of help I can get â™¥

# ""Gameplay"" loop & controls
While there isn't much gameplay yet, the main controls of the game are
* Left and right arrow keys (double tap to dash in a given direction)
* Space to jump
* F to ...parry?

Evil red-tinted godot icon.svg's have overrun the kingdom of placeholdlandia under the rule of the SpawnerNode, your job is to parry them out of existance, though be careful, you're very weak and fragile, a single touch from them means DEATH!
